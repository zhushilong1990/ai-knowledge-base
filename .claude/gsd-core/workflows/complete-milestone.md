<purpose>

Mark a shipped version (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0) as complete. Creates historical record in MILESTONES.md, performs full PROJECT.md evolution review, reorganizes ROADMAP.md with milestone groupings, and tags the release in git.

</purpose>

<required_reading>

1. templates/milestone.md
2. templates/milestone-archive.md
3. `.planning/ROADMAP.md`

5. `.planning/PROJECT.md`

</required_reading>

<archival_behavior>

When a milestone completes:

1. Extract full milestone details to `.planning/milestones/v[X.Y]-ROADMAP.md`
2. Archive requirements to `.planning/milestones/v[X.Y]-REQUIREMENTS.md`
3. Update ROADMAP.md — overwrite in place with milestone grouping (preserve Backlog section)
4. Safety commit archive files + updated ROADMAP.md, then `git rm REQUIREMENTS.md` (fresh for next milestone)
5. Perform full PROJECT.md evolution review
6. Offer to create next milestone inline
7. Archive UI artifacts (`*-UI-SPEC.md`, `*-UI-REVIEW.md`) alongside other phase documents
8. Clean up `.planning/ui-reviews/` screenshot files (binary assets, never archived)

**Context Efficiency:** Archives keep ROADMAP.md constant-size and REQUIREMENTS.md milestone-scoped.

**ROADMAP archive** uses `templates/milestone-archive.md` — includes milestone header (status, phases, date), full phase details, milestone summary (decisions, issues, tech debt).

**REQUIREMENTS archive** contains all requirements marked complete with outcomes, traceability table with final status, notes on changed requirements.

</archival_behavior>

**Compact Content Gate.** Read and follow `gsd-core/references/compact-content-gate.md` now — it states the `workflow.compact_content` check and the resolution rule this spine defers to. When it directs a Read, read `gsd-core/workflows/complete-milestone/detail/elaboration.md` in full before continuing past this point; its content elaborates on the audit-acknowledge branch and the handle_branches step below.

<step name="pre_close_artifact_audit">

RESPONSE_LANGUAGE=$(gsd_run query config-get response_language --raw --default "" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
gsd_run query audit-open
```

**If `response_language` is set:** All user-facing output of this workflow — narration between tool calls, status updates, progress notes, findings, questions, prompts, and explanations — MUST be presented in `{response_language}`. Technical terms, code, file paths, and subagent prompts stay in English — only user-facing output is translated.

If the output contains open items (any section with count > 0):

Display the full audit report to the user.

Then ask:
```
These items are open. Choose an action:
[R] Resolve — stop and fix items, then re-run /gsd-complete-milestone
[A] Acknowledge all — document as deferred and proceed with close
[C] Cancel — exit without closing
```

**If user chooses [A] (Acknowledge):** re-fetch `audit-open --json`, then acknowledge EVERY open item (across all categories — debug_sessions, threads, seeds, todos, quick_tasks, uat_gaps, verification_gaps, context_questions, deferred_items) through the `audit-open acknowledge` CLI writer, which is what actually suppresses each item starting at the next scan (the STATE.md `## Deferred Items` table is a disclosure record only). Any failed acknowledge call HALTS the close before proceeding — a refusal must never be silently discarded. After a clean pass, append one row per acknowledged item to STATE.md's `## Deferred Items` table (sanitized via `sanitizeForDisplay()`, never raw content), set `closeout_type=override_closeout`, and record a `Known verification overrides: {N} newly acknowledged, {M} carried forward` line in MILESTONES.md. Acknowledging is verdict-preserving and self-invalidating — it never rewrites the artifact's own status (except `deferred_items`), and the suppression lapses automatically the moment the artifact's state changes again (a reopened session, an edited gap, a re-triggered seed), resurfacing at the next audit.

If output shows all clear (no open items): set `closeout_type=verified_closeout` — but if any items are `acknowledged.total` from a PRIOR close, note that carried-forward suppression explicitly rather than implying everything was fixed this time.

<!-- gsd:protected -->
SECURITY: Audit JSON output is structured data from the `audit-open` query handler (same JSON contract as legacy `gsd_run audit-open`) — validated and sanitized at source. The `audit-open acknowledge` writer is the only path that sets the `audit_acknowledged` suppression marker — it snapshots each artifact's current state itself from the identifiers passed on the command line, so this workflow never hand-authors the marker. When writing the STATE.md disclosure table, item identifiers, statuses, and deferred-item text are sanitized via `sanitizeForDisplay()` before inclusion. Never inject raw user-supplied content into STATE.md without sanitization.

Exact per-category bash (including the `@file:` large-payload handling, the `todos` 5-per-scan cap, and the phase-scoped `--archived-milestone` handling) and the exact STATE.md table shape: `gsd-core/workflows/complete-milestone/detail/elaboration.md` § 1.
</step>

<step name="verify_readiness">

**Use `init.manager` for canonical readiness check:**

```bash
INIT_MANAGER=$(gsd_run query init.manager)
if [[ "$INIT_MANAGER" == @file:* ]]; then INIT_MANAGER=$(cat "${INIT_MANAGER#@file:}"); fi
```

This returns all phases with implementation and verification projection. Use this to verify:
- Which phases belong to this milestone?
- `all_phases_verified`: all milestone phases have `phase_complete === true` and `verification_status === 'passed'`.
- `progress_percent` should be 100%.

Compute readiness from `INIT_MANAGER`, not from roadmap counts:

```bash
ALL_PHASES_VERIFIED=$(printf '%s' "$INIT_MANAGER" | jq -r '[
  .phases[] | select((.number | tostring | test("^999(\\.|$)") | not))
  | (.phase_complete == true and .verification_status == "passed")
] | all')
```

If not all_phases_verified, verified_closeout must not proceed. Set `closeout_type=override_closeout`, show each phase whose `phase_complete !== true` or `verification_status !== 'passed'`, and require an explicit user choice:
1. **Proceed anyway** — record verification overrides in MILESTONES.md/STATE.md
2. **Run verification first** — `/gsd-verify-work {phase}` or `/gsd-execute-phase {phase}`
3. **Abort** — return to development

Only set `closeout_type=verified_closeout` when `ALL_PHASES_VERIFIED` is `true`.

**Requirements completion check (REQUIRED before presenting):**

Parse REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table:
- Count total v1 requirements vs checked-off (`[x]`) requirements
- Identify any non-Complete rows in the traceability table

Present:

- Phase 4: Polish (1/1 plan complete)

Total: {phase_count} phases, {total_plans} plans
Verification: {all_phases_verified ? "all phases verified" : "override needed"}
Closeout type: {closeout_type}

**If requirements incomplete** (N < M):

```
⚠ Unchecked Requirements:

- [ ] {REQ-ID}: {description} (Phase {X})

```

MUST present 3 options:
1. **Proceed anyway** — mark milestone complete with known gaps
2. **Run audit first** — `/gsd-audit-milestone` to assess gap severity
3. **Abort** — return to development

If user selects "Proceed anyway": set `closeout_type=override_closeout`; note incomplete requirements in MILESTONES.md under `### Known Gaps` with REQ-IDs and descriptions.

```

**Full review checklist:**

1. **"What This Is" accuracy:**
   - Compare current description to what was built
   - Update if product has meaningfully changed

2. **Core Value check:**
   - Still the right priority? Did shipping reveal a different core value?
   - Update if the ONE thing has shifted

3. **Business Context check (only if the section is present):**
   - Skip entirely if PROJECT.md has no `## Business Context` section
   - Customer, revenue model, and success metric still accurate after shipping?
   - Update any field that drifted; refresh the linked strategy doc reference if it moved

4. **Requirements audit:**

   **Validated section:**
   - All Active requirements shipped this milestone → Move to Validated
   - Format: `- ✓ [Requirement] — v[X.Y]`

   **Active section:**
   - Remove requirements moved to Validated
   - Add new requirements for next milestone
   - Keep unaddressed requirements

   **Out of Scope audit:**
   - Review each item — reasoning still valid?
   - Remove irrelevant items
   - Add requirements invalidated during milestone

5. **Context update:**
   - Current codebase state (LOC, tech stack)
   - User feedback themes (if any)
   - Known issues or technical debt

6. **Key Decisions audit:**
   - Extract all decisions from milestone phase summaries
   - Add to Key Decisions table with outcomes
   - Mark ✓ Good, ⚠️ Revisit, or — Pending

7. **Constraints check:**
   - Any constraints changed during development? Update as needed

Update PROJECT.md inline. Update "Last updated" footer:

```markdown
---
*Last updated: [date] after v[X.Y] milestone*
```

**Example full evolution (v1.0 → v1.1 prep):**

Before:

```markdown
## What This Is

A real-time collaborative whiteboard for remote teams.

## Core Value

Real-time sync that feels instant.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Canvas drawing tools
- [ ] Real-time sync < 500ms
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Export to PNG

### Out of Scope

- Mobile app — web-first approach
- Video chat — use external tools
```

After v1.0:

```markdown
## What This Is

A real-time collaborative whiteboard for remote teams with instant sync and drawing tools.

## Core Value

Real-time sync that feels instant.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Canvas drawing tools — v1.0
- ✓ Real-time sync < 500ms — v1.0 (achieved 200ms avg)
- ✓ User authentication — v1.0

### Active

- [ ] Export to PNG
- [ ] Undo/redo history
- [ ] Shape tools (rectangles, circles)

### Out of Scope

- Mobile app — web-first approach, PWA works well
- Video chat — use external tools
- Offline mode — real-time is core value

## Context

Shipped v1.0 with 2,400 LOC TypeScript.
Tech stack: Next.js, Supabase, Canvas API.
Initial user testing showed demand for shape tools.
```

**Step complete when:**

- [ ] "What This Is" reviewed and updated if needed
- [ ] Core Value verified as still correct
- [ ] Business Context checked (or confirmed absent)
- [ ] All shipped requirements moved to Validated
- [ ] New requirements added to Active for next milestone
- [ ] Out of Scope reasoning audited
- [ ] Context updated with current state
- [ ] All milestone decisions added to Key Decisions
- [ ] "Last updated" footer reflects milestone completion

</step>

<step name="archive_milestone">

**Text mode (`workflow.text_mode: true` in config or `--text` flag):** Set `TEXT_MODE=true` if `--text` is present in `$ARGUMENTS` OR `text_mode` from init JSON is `true`. When TEXT_MODE is active, replace every `AskUserQuestion` call with a plain-text numbered list and ask the user to type their choice number. This is required for non-Claude runtimes (OpenAI Codex, Antigravity, etc.) where `AskUserQuestion` is not available.

**Quick-task archival (opt-in — NOT symmetrical with phase archival below, #2142):** unlike phase archival, quick-task archival is **opt-in, default OFF**. Doing nothing leaves `.planning/quick/` untouched, exactly like today's behavior. Decide this BEFORE calling `milestone complete` below, so the flag can be folded into that single invocation rather than issuing a second, redundant call.

If `.planning/quick/` contains at least one directory, ask:

AskUserQuestion: "Archive completed quick tasks into this milestone too?" with options: "Yes — archive quick tasks into v[X.Y]" | "Skip"

If "Yes": set `ARCHIVE_QUICK_FLAG="--archive-quick"`. If "Skip" (or `.planning/quick/` is empty): set `ARCHIVE_QUICK_FLAG=""`.

**Delegate archival to `gsd_run query milestone.complete`:**

```bash
ARCHIVE=$(gsd_run query milestone.complete "v[X.Y]" --name "[Milestone Name]" --confirm $ARCHIVE_QUICK_FLAG)
```

`--confirm` is required (#3726): the archive is irreversible (ROADMAP/REQUIREMENTS archived, phase
directories MOVED, STATE.md rewritten), so `milestone complete` refuses to mutate without it. This
workflow has already gathered the user's explicit intent by this step, so passing the flag here is
correct; `--dry-run` previews the exact move list without mutating if a preview is ever needed first.

The CLI handles:
- Creating `.planning/milestones/` directory
- Archiving ROADMAP.md to `milestones/v[X.Y]-ROADMAP.md`
- Archiving REQUIREMENTS.md to `milestones/v[X.Y]-REQUIREMENTS.md` with archive header
- Moving audit file to milestones if it exists
- Creating/appending MILESTONES.md entry with accomplishments from SUMMARY.md files
- Updating STATE.md (status, last activity)
- When `ARCHIVE_QUICK_FLAG` is `--archive-quick`: moving every directory under `.planning/quick/` into `.planning/milestones/v[X.Y]-quick/`, writing a `README.md` index into that archive directory (generated by scanning the archive directory itself), and clearing the data rows of STATE.md's `### Quick Tasks Completed` table — preserving the table's header and whichever column variant (with/without a Status column) was detected

Extract from result: `version`, `date`, `phases`, `plans`, `tasks`, `accomplishments`, `archived`.

Verify: `✅ Milestone archived to .planning/milestones/`

**Known limit (quick-task archival):** there is no on-disk provenance recording which milestone a given quick task belonged to. Archival buckets **all** remaining `.planning/quick/*` into the completing milestone — a quick task that predates an earlier, unarchived milestone lands in the current bucket regardless.

Verify after `--archive-quick` was passed: `✅ Quick tasks archived to .planning/milestones/v[X.Y]-quick/`

**Phase archival (default-on):** `milestone complete` archives phase directories to `milestones/v[X.Y]-phases/` by default (#1871), so the next `/gsd-new-milestone` never inherits un-archived dirs. No manual `mkdir`/`mv` or `--archive-phases` flag is needed.

If the user explicitly wants to keep phase directories in place as raw execution history, invoke `milestone complete` with `--no-archive-phases`:

```bash
gsd_run query milestone complete v[X.Y] --no-archive-phases --confirm
```

Verify after a default (archived) completion: `✅ Phase directories archived to .planning/milestones/v[X.Y]-phases/`

After archival, the AI still handles:
- Reorganizing ROADMAP.md with milestone grouping (requires judgment) — overwrite in place after extracting Backlog section, with the write-guard's single-use sentinel armed first (a per-step env var cannot reach a hook — see the reorganize step for the sentinel mechanics)
- Full PROJECT.md evolution review (requires understanding)
- Safety commit of archive files + updated ROADMAP.md, then `git rm .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- These are NOT fully delegated because they require AI interpretation of content

</step>

<step name="reorganize_roadmap_and_delete_originals">

After `milestone complete` has archived, reorganize ROADMAP.md with milestone groupings, then commit archives as a safety checkpoint before removing originals.

**Backlog preservation — do this FIRST before rewriting ROADMAP.md:**

Extract the Backlog section from the current ROADMAP.md before making any changes:

```bash
INIT_REORG=$(gsd_run query init.complete-milestone)
if [[ "$INIT_REORG" == @file:* ]]; then INIT_REORG=$(cat "${INIT_REORG#@file:}"); fi
_gsd_field() { node -e "const o=JSON.parse(process.argv[1]); const v=o[process.argv[2]]; process.stdout.write(v==null?'':String(v))" "$1" "$2"; }
ROADMAP_PATH=$(_gsd_field "$INIT_REORG" roadmap_path)
# Extract lines under ## Backlog through end of file (or next ## section)
BACKLOG_SECTION=$(awk '/^## Backlog/{found=1} found{print}' "$ROADMAP_PATH")
```

If `$BACKLOG_SECTION` is empty, there is no Backlog section — skip silently.

**Reorganize ROADMAP.md** — overwrite in place (do NOT delete first) with milestone groupings.

This rewrite is an *intentional* catastrophic shrink: phase detail was just archived to `milestones/v[X.Y]-ROADMAP.md`, and a multi-hundred-line ROADMAP.md collapses to a compact grouped summary. The `gsd-write-guard` PreToolUse hook (#2255) hard-blocks exactly that shape on curated `.planning/` files — this step is the legitimate milestone reset its escape hatch exists for. A hook inherits the *runtime's* environment, so no per-step env var can reach it; the hatch is a **single-use sentinel file the guard itself consumes**. Arm it, then write:

1. Arm the sentinel (single-use; the guard checks it is fresh — within 15 minutes — and names exactly this file, then consumes it):

```bash
INIT_REORG=$(gsd_run query init.complete-milestone)
if [[ "$INIT_REORG" == @file:* ]]; then INIT_REORG=$(cat "${INIT_REORG#@file:}"); fi
_gsd_field() { node -e "const o=JSON.parse(process.argv[1]); const v=o[process.argv[2]]; process.stdout.write(v==null?'':String(v))" "$1" "$2"; }
ROADMAP_PATH=$(_gsd_field "$INIT_REORG" roadmap_path)
printf '%s\n' "$ROADMAP_PATH" > .planning/.gsd-allow-shrink
echo "Write target: $ROADMAP_PATH"
```

2. Compose the full new ROADMAP.md content (template below) and overwrite the file at **`$ROADMAP_PATH`** (the "Write target" path printed above — under an active workstream this is the workstream-scoped roadmap, NOT the literal `.planning/ROADMAP.md`) with the **Write tool** — the normal path. The guard allows this one shrink and deletes the sentinel. If the Write is blocked anyway, the sentinel was stale or consumed — re-run the `printf` and retry the Write.

Template for the composed content:

```markdown
# Roadmap: [Project Name]

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.0 MVP** — Phases 1-4 (shipped YYYY-MM-DD)
- 🚧 **v1.1 Security** — Phases 5-6 (in progress)

## Phases

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.0 MVP (Phases 1-4) — SHIPPED YYYY-MM-DD</summary>

- [x] Phase 1: Foundation (2/2 plans) — completed YYYY-MM-DD
- [x] Phase 2: Authentication (2/2 plans) — completed YYYY-MM-DD

</details>
```

**Re-append Backlog section after the rewrite** (only if `$BACKLOG_SECTION` was non-empty):

Append the extracted Backlog content verbatim to the end of the newly written ROADMAP.md. This ensures 999.x backlog items are never silently dropped during milestone reorganization.

**Safety commit — commit archive files BEFORE deleting any originals:**

```bash
INIT_REORG=$(gsd_run query init.complete-milestone)
if [[ "$INIT_REORG" == @file:* ]]; then INIT_REORG=$(cat "${INIT_REORG#@file:}"); fi
_gsd_field() { node -e "const o=JSON.parse(process.argv[1]); const v=o[process.argv[2]]; process.stdout.write(v==null?'':String(v))" "$1" "$2"; }
STATE_PATH=$(_gsd_field "$INIT_REORG" state_path)
ROADMAP_PATH=$(_gsd_field "$INIT_REORG" roadmap_path)
ARCHIVE_DIR=$(_gsd_field "$INIT_REORG" archive_dir)
MILESTONES_PATH=$(_gsd_field "$INIT_REORG" milestones_path)
PROJECT_PATH=$(_gsd_field "$INIT_REORG" project_path)
gsd_run query commit "chore: archive v[X.Y] milestone files" --files "${ARCHIVE_DIR}/v[X.Y]-ROADMAP.md" "${ARCHIVE_DIR}/v[X.Y]-REQUIREMENTS.md" "${ARCHIVE_DIR}/v[X.Y]-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md" "$MILESTONES_PATH" "$PROJECT_PATH" "$STATE_PATH" "$ROADMAP_PATH"
```

This creates a durable checkpoint in git history. If anything fails after this point, the working tree can be reconstructed from git.

MILESTONES.md and PROJECT.md are workstream-scoped the same way STATE.md/ROADMAP.md are (`planningPaths(cwd).planning`/`.project`) — under an active workstream this commits the actual files `milestone complete` wrote, not the root copies.

**Remove REQUIREMENTS.md via git rm** (preserves history, stages deletion atomically):

```bash
INIT_REORG=$(gsd_run query init.complete-milestone)
if [[ "$INIT_REORG" == @file:* ]]; then INIT_REORG=$(cat "${INIT_REORG#@file:}"); fi
_gsd_field() { node -e "const o=JSON.parse(process.argv[1]); const v=o[process.argv[2]]; process.stdout.write(v==null?'':String(v))" "$1" "$2"; }
REQUIREMENTS_PATH=$(_gsd_field "$INIT_REORG" requirements_path)
git rm "$REQUIREMENTS_PATH"
```

</step>

<step name="write_retrospective">

**Append to living retrospective:**

Check for existing retrospective:
```bash
ls .planning/RETROSPECTIVE.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

**If exists:** Read the file, append new milestone section before the "## Cross-Milestone Trends" section.

**If doesn't exist:** Create from template at `D:/code/ai-knowledge-base/.claude/gsd-core/templates/retrospective.md`.

**Gather retrospective data:**

1. From SUMMARY.md files: Extract key deliverables, one-liners, tech decisions
2. From VERIFICATION.md files: Extract verification scores, gaps found
3. From UAT.md files: Extract test results, issues found
4. From git log: Count commits, calculate timeline
5. From the milestone work: Reflect on what worked and what didn't

**Update cross-milestone trends:**

If the "## Cross-Milestone Trends" section exists, update the tables with new data from this milestone.

**Commit:**
```bash
gsd_run query commit "docs: update retrospective for v${VERSION}" --files .planning/RETROSPECTIVE.md
```

</step>

<step name="update_state">

Most STATE.md updates were handled by `milestone complete`, but verify and update remaining fields:

**Project Reference:**

```markdown
## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated [today])

**Core value:** [Current core value from PROJECT.md]
**Current focus:** [Next milestone or "Planning next milestone"]
```

**Accumulated Context:**
- Clear decisions summary (full log in PROJECT.md)
- Clear resolved blockers
- Keep open blockers for next milestone

</step>

<step name="handle_branches">

Check the project's `branching_strategy` (from `init.execute-phase`/`init.complete-milestone`). `"none"` skips straight to `git_tag`. For `"phase"` or `"milestone"`, list the matching branches (by the configured prefix template); no branches found also skips to `git_tag`. Resolve the base branch through the single shared resolver, never a bare `main`/`master` fallback (Issue #1146):
```bash
BASE_BRANCH=$(gsd_run query git.base-branch)
```

If branches exist, present them and ask (AskUserQuestion): **Squash merge** (recommended) / **Merge with history** / **Delete without merging** / **Keep branches**. All three merge/delete options iterate every matching branch (phase strategy) or the one milestone branch, checking out `BASE_BRANCH` first and returning to the original branch after; both merge options strip `.planning/` from staging first when `commit_docs` is false. "Keep branches" just reports them as preserved for manual handling.

Exact bash for each of the four options (squash, history-preserving merge, delete, keep): `gsd-core/workflows/complete-milestone/detail/elaboration.md` § 2.

</step>

If `section_manifest` is `null` or `"git-tag"` is in its `included` list: read and execute `gsd-core/workflows/complete-milestone/steps/git-tag.md`. Otherwise skip — do not read the file; proceed to `git_commit_milestone`.

<step name="git_commit_milestone">

Commit the REQUIREMENTS.md deletion (archive files and ROADMAP.md were already committed in the safety commit in `reorganize_roadmap_and_delete_originals`).

```bash
git commit -m "chore: remove REQUIREMENTS.md for v[X.Y] milestone"
```

Confirm: "Committed: chore: remove REQUIREMENTS.md for v[X.Y] milestone"

</step>

<step name="offer_next">

<milestone_naming>

**Version conventions:**
- **v1.0** — Initial MVP
- **v1.1, v1.2** — Minor updates, new features, fixes
- **v2.0, v3.0** — Major rewrites, breaking changes, new direction

**Names:** Short 1-2 words (v1.0 MVP, v1.1 Security, v1.2 Performance, v2.0 Redesign).

</milestone_naming>

<what_qualifies>

**Create milestones for:** Initial release, public releases, major feature sets shipped, before archiving planning.

**Don't create milestones for:** Every phase completion (too granular), work in progress, internal dev iterations (unless truly shipped).

Heuristic: "Is this deployed/usable/shipped?" If yes → milestone. If no → keep working.

</what_qualifies>
