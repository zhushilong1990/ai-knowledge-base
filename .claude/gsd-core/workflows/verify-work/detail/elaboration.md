# verify-work.md — deferred elaboration

Read in full when `workflow.compact_content` is `false` (the default) — see
`gsd-core/references/compact-content-gate.md` for the check and resolution rule this
spine defers to. Each `§` below is the full text the spine condenses at the point it
names.

## § 1 — reconcile_gaps

**Reconcile diagnosed gaps against completed gap-closure plans (#1921):**

When verify-work resumes after `/gsd-execute-phase --gaps-only`, the UAT `## Gaps` entries still read `status: failed` even though their fix plans have executed. Without reconciliation verify-work re-diagnoses them as fresh blockers and spawns new gap plans — losing the verification state. This step closes the loop.

Read the UAT `## Gaps` section and the phase dir `*-PLAN.md` frontmatter. For each gap with `status: failed`:
1. Find a `*-PLAN.md` whose frontmatter `gap_ids` includes the gap's `gap_id` (`G-{phase}-{N}`).
2. If such a plan exists AND has a matching `*-SUMMARY.md` in the phase dir (the plan was executed by `--gaps-only`), the gap is **resolved** — update its YAML in place:
   ```yaml
   - gap_id: G-{phase}-{N}
     status: resolved        # was: failed
     resolved_by: {plan basename}
     resolved_at: {today}
   ```
3. If no plan references the `gap_id`, or the plan has no SUMMARY, leave the gap `status: failed` (still open).

Read plan frontmatter directly in-context — do not pipe it through a shell parser. After reconciliation, announce:
```
Reconciled gap-closure state: {resolved_count} gap(s) resolved by executed plans, {open_count} still open.
```

Resolved gaps are NOT re-diagnosed and do NOT spawn new gap plans. If the user later reports the same behavior as still broken, treat it as a new issue (a regression) with a fresh `gap_id`.

## § 2 — resume_from_file

**Resume testing from UAT file:**

**First run `reconcile_gaps`** (above) so gaps already fixed by `/gsd-execute-phase --gaps-only` are marked `resolved` before testing resumes (#1921).

Read the full UAT file.

(The find-pending / zero-pending guard clause is stated verbatim in the spine — a pre-existing
drift guard, `tests/verify-work-auto-transition.test.cjs` bug #1716, requires the two sentences
adjacent with nothing between them.)

Announce:
```
Resuming: Phase {phase} UAT
Progress: {passed + issues + skipped}/{total}
Issues found so far: {issues count}

Continuing from Test {N}...
```

Update Current Test section with the pending test.
Then continue to `present_test` with it.

## § 3 — diagnose_issues, plan_gap_closure, verify_gap_plans, revision_loop (the gap-closure sub-flow)

This whole sub-flow only runs when UAT testing found issues (`complete_session` routes here); a
session with zero issues never reaches it.

### diagnose_issues

**Diagnose root causes before planning fixes:**

```
---

{N} issues found. Diagnosing root causes...

Spawning parallel debug agents to investigate each issue.
```

- Load diagnose-issues workflow
- Follow @D:/code/ai-knowledge-base/.claude/gsd-core/workflows/diagnose-issues.md
- Spawn parallel debug agents for each issue
- Collect root causes
- Update UAT.md with root causes
- Proceed to `plan_gap_closure`

Diagnosis runs automatically - no user prompt. Parallel agents investigate simultaneously, so overhead is minimal and fixes are more accurate.

### plan_gap_closure

**Auto-plan fixes from diagnosed gaps:**

Display:
```
### GSD ► PLANNING FIXES

◆ Spawning planner for gap closure... (runs in a subagent — no output until it returns, ~1–5 min; expected, not a freeze)
```

Spawn gsd-planner in --gaps mode:

<!-- #2517 model-omit-on-inherit -->

> **Model omission (#2517).** Omit the `model` parameter entirely when the value it would carry (`planner_model`, `checker_model`) is `"inherit"` or empty. An empty value 404s on runtimes without native tier aliases — the default on non-Claude runtimes. Omitting it inherits the orchestrator's model. See @gsd-core/references/model-profile-resolution.md.

<!-- #2508 runtime-aware-dispatch -->

> **Runtime-aware dispatch (#2508 Phase 4).** GSD workflows dispatch specialized subagents by role. Before dispatching on a built-in-only runtime (kimi-code — three built-ins only), resolve the role to a built-in via `gsd_run query resolve-dispatch-type --requested <role> --raw`. On named-dispatch runtimes (Claude/OpenCode/…) the role is returned unchanged; on kimi-code it maps to `coder`/`explore`/`plan` by role-suffix. The persona rides `${AGENT_SKILLS_<ROLE>}` (Phase 3) regardless. See @gsd-core/references/runtime-aware-dispatch.md.

**Gap linkage (#1921):** each created `*-PLAN.md` MUST list the UAT gap ids it addresses in its frontmatter:
```yaml
---
gap_closure: true
gap_ids: [G-{phase}-{N}, ...]   # the ## Gaps gap_id values this plan fixes
---
```
This lets `/gsd-verify-work` reconcile resolved gaps on resume (a gap whose plan has a matching `*-SUMMARY.md` is marked `status: resolved`, not re-diagnosed as a fresh blocker).

(The "stop working, wait for the subagent" orchestrator rule is stated in the spine, not repeated here.)

### verify_gap_plans

**Verify fix plans with checker:**

Display:
```
### GSD ► VERIFYING FIX PLANS

◆ Spawning plan checker... (runs in a subagent — no output until it returns, ~1–5 min; expected, not a freeze)
```

  description="Verify Phase {phase} fix plans"
)
```

(The "stop working, wait for the subagent" orchestrator rule, and the on-return handling for
VERIFICATION PASSED / ISSUES FOUND, are stated in the spine — the ISSUES FOUND handler's exact
wording is pinned by `tests/plan-checker-coupling.test.cjs`.)

### revision_loop

The full conflict-handling contract (non-binding `fix_hint`, the BEFORE-editing constraint
re-check, `## REVISION_CONFLICT` routing, the same-property/THIRD-conflict stall bound, and the
max-iteration escalation) is stated verbatim in the spine — a pre-existing drift guard
(`tests/revision-remediation-binding.test.cjs`, #3771) pins it there across every revision
orchestrator in the repo. This section adds only the surrounding `Agent()` scaffolding:

```
