 * External-descriptor trust gate (ADR-1239 Phase C-2, #1681).
 *
 * Load-time `configHome` write-confinement for installed third-party host-plugin
 * descriptors. The opt-in loader (`loadRegistry({includeInstalled:true})`) already
 * applies schema validation + consent + first-party-wins + fail-closed gates;
 * this adds defense-in-depth: **before** a third-party descriptor's install plan
 * is ever executed, assert every destSubpath it declares resolves within the
 * user-approved `configHome`. A path-escaping or malformed descriptor is
 * rejected fail-closed.
 *
 * This is the load-time twin of Phase 2's install-time gate
 * (`assertDestWithinConfigHome` in runtime-artifact-install-plan.cts, #1679 AC3).
 * The two are defense-in-depth: load-time rejects malformed descriptors early
 * (before consent even matters); install-time bounds the actual writes.
 *
 * Do NOT conflate with ADR-1577's prompt-injection circuit-breaker — separate
 * concern sharing the word "trust".

/**
 * Pure LEXICAL path-containment check (cross-platform). `target` is confined
 * to `root` iff resolving it relative to `root` (via `path.resolve` — string
 * manipulation, no filesystem access) yields a path equal to or under `root`.
 * Absolute paths outside `root` and `..`-escapes return false.
 *
 * NOT a realpath check: this function never calls `fs.realpathSync` and does
 * not detect a symlink along `target` (or an existing path component of
 * `root`) that would redirect the LEXICALLY-confined path to a physically
 * different, unconfined location on disk. A caller relying on this for a
 * write-confinement guarantee against a symlink-planting attacker must pair
 * it with a symlink check (or refuse to follow symlinks at write time). Only
 * the capability-loader.cts route into assertDescriptorConfined gets this for
 * free today: capability-source.cts's staging path rejects symlinks upstream,
 * before a target ever reaches a lexical-only check like this one — see
 * copyDirRecursive's `entry.isSymbolicLink()` throw (capability-source.cts:585-586)
 * and the post-copy budget-walk re-check (capability-source.cts:671-674). This
 * does NOT extend to isPathConfined's other callers: install-engine.cts:1608
 * and install-profiles.cts:755,880 do not go through capability-source.cts's
 * adapters at all and have no symlink guard of their own here. Of the
 * remaining callers, only retired-artifact-cleanup.cts:69 carries its own
 * defense, via a local `lstatSync(destDir).isSymbolicLink()` check at line 77.
 *
 * `opts.pathImpl` (default: the ambient `path` module) lets a caller inject
 * `path.win32` or `path.posix`. This is security-relevant: the win32 branch
 * (drive letters, UNC paths, `\` separator) is otherwise only reachable by
 * actually running this process on a Windows host, so without injection a
 * win32-specific confinement escape would be unverified on every other
 * platform. This mirrors the platform-injection seam already used elsewhere
 * in this repo, e.g. src/shell-command-projection.cts's `opts.platform`
 * (#4641). All existing 2-arg callers are unaffected: the default resolves to
 * the ambient `path`, preserving byte-identical behaviour.
 *
 * The containment DECISION here now comes from the canonical predicate in
 * src/security.cts (`tryWithinRootLexical`, ADR-4650 decision 6) — this
 * function keeps only the lexical RESOLUTION policy (no realpath, no
 * filesystem access) as its own choice; the comparison itself is shared.
