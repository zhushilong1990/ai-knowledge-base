 * `gsd-core/workflows/pr-branch.md` cannot `require()` this module at
 * runtime — a workflow markdown file has no module system, and its bash
 * steps are copy-pasted text executed by whatever shell interprets the
 * workflow. So the three exported constants below are mirrored VERBATIM
 * into that file's `TRANSIENT_DIRS=`, `STRUCTURAL_RE=`, and
 * `MILESTONE_PHASES_RE=` bash variable assignments, and
 * `scripts/lint-pr-branch-pattern-drift.cjs` asserts the mirror never
 * drifts from this file (compiled to `gsd-core/bin/lib/pr-branch-patterns.cjs`)
 * as part of `npm run lint:ci`. Change a value here, then update
 * `gsd-core/workflows/pr-branch.md` to match, or the drift guard fails.
 *
 * This module does not read the filesystem and has no dependencies (a leaf
 * module, mirroring `src/secrets.cts` / `src/planning-scope.cts`).
