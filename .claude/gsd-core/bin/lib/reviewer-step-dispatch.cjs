/**
 * Reviewer Step Dispatch (#4209 Phase 1 Plan 2, ADR-2782 seam).
 *
 * ONE interpreter for "a step declares `supportsReviewerLanes: true`" — see
 * `gsd-core/references/loop-hook-dispatch.md` for the canonical explanation of the trait and how
 * `review-lane dispatch-step` re-derives it. This module trusts `trait` exactly as given: it is
 * the CALLER's job to have derived it correctly. Every direct or lifecycle caller routes through
 * `dispatchReviewerLanes` so selection/plan/invoke logic is owned once, not re-derived per
 * feature. This module owns NONE of those primitives — it wires `resolveReviewerSelection`
 * (selection) and `resolveLanePlan` (planning), the same building blocks
 * `gsd-core/bin/gsd-tools.cjs`'s `review-lane plan` subcommand uses. Invocation (`runLane`) needs
 * OS-aware spawn/probe plumbing this module does not own, so `deps.invoke` is the one required,
 * caller-supplied seam (wired for real in `gsd-core/bin/gsd-tools.cjs`'s `review-lane
 * dispatch-step` route).
 *
 * Fail-closed contract:
 * - Trait not exactly `true`, or nothing selected → inert. Zero plan/invoke calls.
 * - Missing/unsafe request-level input (paths escaping `repoRoot`, absent depth/base SHA) stops
 *   the WHOLE dispatch before any lane is planned or invoked.
 * - An explicitly requested lane the selector could not resolve does not silently narrow the
 *   result to only what worked: lanes that DID resolve still run and their results are kept,
 *   but the aggregate `ok` is `false` so no caller mistakes a partial run for a clean one.
 * - Once a lane is planned, a per-lane plan/budget/invoke failure never displaces or cancels a
 *   sibling lane already run.
 * - A lane whose `promptChannel` is `'none'` (it reviews the working tree on its own terms, fed
 *   nothing — e.g. `coderabbit`) cannot receive the bounded prompt below and is rejected before
 *   plan/invoke, same as an unresolved slug.
 *
 * The bounded source-review prompt built here is METADATA ONLY — repository root, canonical
 * file paths, review depth, base SHA, and four fixed prohibitions. It never embeds file
 * contents. If the assembled prompt exceeds a lane's resolved budget, that lane's dispatch
 * hard-fails before `invoke` runs for it — no silent truncation of the file list.
