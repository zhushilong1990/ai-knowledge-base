 *
 * ADR-2143 §3 ("addressed by NAME, never ordinal"): the Progress table is

 * is a SUPERSET of the canonical `Phase` / `Plans Complete` / `Status` /
 * `Completed` names, in any order, tolerating extra/injected unrelated
 * columns (#2137's fast-check property test shuffles headers and injects
 * columns and asserts the derived counts never change). This supersedes the
 * earlier `findTableBySchema` exact-schema lookup, which required an exact
 * canonical column SET+ORDER and returned all-null on any reordering or
 * injection.
 *
 * Scoped to the `## Progress` section when the document has one (#2012 decoy
 * avoidance — a differently-headed table sharing the same column names must
 * not be picked up instead); a headingless milestone slice (#1445) falls back
 * to scanning the whole input, preserving the "Progress table not under a
 * `## Progress` heading, or not the first table in the document, still

 * owns `integer percent -> filled cells`, and is the single place that rounding
 * is expressed. Five inline copies of the rounding carried it before this
 * change — three in `commands.cts`, and one each in `gsd2-import.cts` and
 * `formatProgressMachineSegment` here; the latter two used `/ 10` with the
 * width already substituted (`pct` in `gsd2-import.cts`, `clamped` in the
 * formatter). (#4294 counts SIX call sites because it counts
 * `cmdStateUpdateProgress` and `syncCore` separately; #4231 had already routed
 * both through `formatProgressMachineSegment` — as it does
 * `applyPostSyncPreservation` — so by this branch's base they share one copy.)
 * Every copy saturated: at width 10 that rounds to a full bar from 95 up, at
 * width 20 from 98 up, so a project at 19/20 plans drew the same bar as a
 * shipped one beside a number that said otherwise.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - A FULL bar is reserved for an actual 100. Below 100 the fill is held one
 *     cell short of the width. This is the only departure from the old formula:
 *     at width 10 exactly 95-99 move (10 -> 9), at width 20 exactly 98-99
 *     (20 -> 19); every other percent in 0-100 rounds as before.
 *   - `null` / `undefined` / non-finite renders an empty bar, matching the
 *     `percent === null ? 0 : ...` guard the `progress` renderers already carried.
 *   - Out-of-range input is clamped to 0-100 before rounding, so the count is
 *     always within `[0, width]` and a `'░'.repeat(width - filled)` can never
 *     be handed a negative count (the old inline form threw `RangeError` at
 *     120%). A non-positive width yields 0.
 *
 * Callers wanting the glyph run call `renderProgressBar`; this is exported so
 * the rounding rule can be pinned directly against the legacy curve.
