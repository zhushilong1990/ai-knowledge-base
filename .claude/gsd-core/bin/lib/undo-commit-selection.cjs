/**
 * Undo Commit Selection — issue #4661 (absorbed into epic #4906, Phase 5).
 *
 * Pure scope-matching logic for `/gsd:undo --phase N` / `--plan N-M`, replacing
 * the two hand-rolled `git log --oneline | grep -E ...` pipelines that used to
 * live in `gsd-core/workflows/undo.md`. Those greps were unanchored substring
 * matches against a live regex built from unvalidated user input — four
 * documented bug classes (see #4661):
 *
 *   1. The id was interpolated raw into an ERE: `.` and `+` are live
 *      metacharacters there, so a malformed or merely differently-shaped id
 *      silently matched the WRONG phase.
 *   2. The grep was unanchored, so a commit that only MENTIONS a scope
 *      (`docs(99-01): explain feat(03-01): commit convention`) was wrongly
 *      selected as a DECLARATION of it.
 *   3. Phase-mode's `\):` suffix and plan-mode's missing suffix disagreed on
 *      the same commit (`feat(03-01)!: breaking change`).
 *   4. The "obvious" fix — anchoring `git log --oneline`'s record start —
 *      is a trap: it silently drops `fixup! ...` / `Revert "..."` wrapper
 *      commits (a worse failure, a silent partial revert) and returns zero
 *      matches under `color.ui=always` (ANSI codes precede the sha).
 *
 * This module closes all four by parsing each commit subject through the
 * SAME anchored conventional-commit grammar the changelog/PR-title gate uses
 * (`HEADER_RE`, reused verbatim from `scripts/release-notes/conventional-title.cjs`
 * — see the require() below), then comparing the extracted scope to the
 * caller-supplied target id by exact STRING EQUALITY. No regex is built from
 * user input at any point past `validatePhaseNumber` (src/security.cts),
 * which the CLI caller (`gsd-tools.cjs query select-revert-commits`) runs
 * BEFORE this module ever sees the id.
 *
 * Deliberately no `fs`/`child_process` in this file: it operates purely on
 * `{sha, subject}` records the caller already fetched (e.g. via `git log
 * --format=%H%x00%s`), so it is unit-testable without touching git or the
 * filesystem.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT (documented, not a defect): `unwrapSubject` unwraps ONE level
 * of a `fixup! `/`squash! `/`Revert "..."` wrapper. A doubly-wrapped subject
 * (e.g. `Revert "fixup! feat(03-01): work"`) is treated as unparseable (no
 * declared scope) after that single unwrap — it is NOT selected, never
 * mis-selected. This bounds the module to the wrapper shapes git itself
 * produces (`fixup!`/`squash!` from `--fixup`/`--squash`, `Revert "..."` from
 * `git revert`), each of which wraps a single ordinary commit subject, not
 * another wrapper.
